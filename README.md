The provided C code offers a concise and effective solution to the locker toggling problem. 
It begins by prompting the user to input the number of lockers (`n`), which determines the size of 
the array used to represent locker states. Each locker is initialized to a closed state (`0`) using a 
simple loop.

The core of the algorithm lies in its nested loop structure, which simulates the toggling 
process over `n` passes. For each pass `i`, the inner loop toggles the state of lockers whose indices 
are multiples of `i`. This ensures that lockers are toggled according to their position in the pass 
sequence.

After completing all passes, the code outputs the final state of each locker, clearly 
indicating whether it is open (`1`) or closed (`0`). Additionally, it counts and displays the number 
of lockers that remain open after all passes, providing a comprehensive solution to the problem.
The code's clarity and efficiency are notable, employing basic array operations and 
straightforward logic to achieve its objectives. While it operates with a time complexity of O(n^2) 
due to the nested loops, this is suitable for moderate values of `n` but could be a limiting factor for 
very large inputs.

Overall, the provided code demonstrates effective problem-solving skills in handling the 
locker toggling problem, offering a clear implementation that balances simplicity and 
functionality.
